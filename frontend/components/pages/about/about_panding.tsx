          The pandemic of COVID-19 led to the temporary closure of health clubs
          and gyms owing to worldwide lockdown, impacting the demand for workout
          equipment in 2020. As a result of decreasing demand for fitness
          centers, the sector faced a temporary slowdown. Several people avoided

          technology such as Apple watches and Fitbit for an accurate
